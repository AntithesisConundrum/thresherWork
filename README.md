* homepage: Places the story in "most popular" area
* _If a story is tagged with both of these, it will appear in the slideshow on the homepage._

# Templates
* default: This is what you usually want. Makes the first image under "media" up big, with all subsequent images pushed to the side as small.
* vertical-feat-img: This is used for ops where the image is the authors' headshot.
* If there's a problem or an editor wants something special, you can choose "no-feat-img-no-sb" and then input the images manually through the editor.

# Images
* Add photo credits by going to the Media page for that photo, then editing the caption field.

# Best Practices
* Keep main images relatively horizontal.

# SnWorks weird things
* Images should always be ".png" or ".jpg". Things that will break SnWorks: ".svg", ".jpeg", ".JPG", etc.
